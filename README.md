## Description
This project is my **first React project**.  
The aim is to build a simple and clean **To-Do application** using React fundamentals.  
The project is created as **Version 1 (v1)** and will be improved step by step.

---

## Problem Statement
The user should be able to:
- Create new to-do tasks
- Mark tasks as done or undone
- Delete tasks
- Keep tasks even after page refresh (LocalStorage)

## Objective
To improve my understanding of:
- React components
- Props & state management
- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- Basic project structuring
- Using LocalStorage in React

---

## User Stories
- When I click the **add (+) button**, I can add a new to-do task.
- When I click on a task, I can mark it as **completed or uncompleted**.
- When I click the **delete icon**, I can remove the task from the list.
- Completed tasks are visually different from active tasks.

---

## Technologies Used
- React
- JavaScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- LocalStorage

---

## Versioning
- **v1** – Initial React To-Do App  
  (Basic CRUD operations, LocalStorage support)

Future versions will include UI improvements and new features.

---

## Notes
This project is created for **learning purposes** and will be updated as I improve my React skills.
